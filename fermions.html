                <p>A fermion is any particle that has an odd half-integer (like 1/2, 3/2, and so forth) spin. Quarks and
                    leptons, as well
                    as most composite particles, like protons and neutrons, are fermions.</p>

                <p>For reasons we do not fully understand, a consequence of the odd half-integer spin is that fermions
                    obey the Pauli
                    Exclusion Principle and therefore cannot co-exist in the same state at same location at the same
                    time <a href="https://particleadventure.org/fermibos.html">[3]</a>.</p>

                <p>Thus Fermions are solitary. Only one Fermion may occupy any quantum state – the Fermionic
                    solitariness of electrons is
                    responsible for the structure of molecular matter (in fact for all ‘structure’ in the universe). The
                    degeneracy pressure
                    that stabilizes white dwarf and neutron stars is a result of fermions resisting further compression
                    towards each other.
                    Fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics <a

            <h3 id="quarks">Quarks</h3>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>Quarks (named by Nobel prize-winner Murray Gell-Mann after a quote in the book "Finnegan's Wake" by
                    James Joyce) are currently believed to be the most fundamental particles that exist; that is, they
                    cannot be broken down into
                    further constituent particles. Quarks are also not themselves particles; rather, they refer to
                    families of
                    particles, each containing six members. The quark family of particles consists of up, down, top,
                    bottom, charm and
                    strange particles.</p>

                <p>When these quarks are grouped together, the sum of their charges always adds up to a integer charge.
                    For example, if two
                    up quarks and one down quark (with charges of +2/3 and -1/3, respectively) are grouped together, the
                    sum of the charges
                    adds up to +1, and a new particle is created. This new particle is the proton, one of the major
                    components of the atomic
                    nucleus.</p>

                <p>While quarks all have a fractional charge, a quark will never freely exist in nature; this is because
                    of a fundamental
                    force known as the "strong force." The strong force, which is mediated by force-carrying particles
                    called gluons, acts
                    within the nucleus of atoms and keeps quarks attracted to one another. The force between quarks
                    increases as they move
                    apart, ensuring that a free quark is never detected. The field of study dedicated to the
                    interactions between quarks and
                    gluons is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
                </p>

                <p>There are four fundamental forces in nature: the strong force (which holds atomic nuclei and quarks
                    together), the weak
                    force (which is responsible for radioactive decay), the electromagnetic force (which helps keep
                    atoms together) and the
                    gravitational force (which acts any object with mass or energy in the universe). Quarks are subject
                    to all of the
                    fundamental forces <a

            <h3 id="leptons">Leptons</h3>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>Leptons are actually believed to be fundamental particles as well, but the leptons family consist of
                    the electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau and tau neutrino particles. There are also
                    antiparticles associated with each particle, the antiparticle being the mirror opposite of the
                    corresponding particle
                    (e.g. having the opposite charge).</p>

                <p>Leptons have an electric charge of either one fundamental charge unit (defined as the charge of a
                    single electron), in
                    the case of the electron, muon or tau, or no charge, in the case of the corresponding neutrinos.</p>

                <p>While quarks are subject to all of the fundamental forces; leptons, on the other hand, are subject to
                    all forces except for the strong force. This is because the strong force has a very short range,
                    typically smaller than that of an atomic
                    nucleus; therefore, the strong force is generally confined to this area. The weak, electromagnetic
                    and gravitational
                    forces, on the other hand, can act over a much greater distance than the strong force can <a
