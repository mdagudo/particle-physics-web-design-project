            <p>The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was founded in 1954, the CERN laboratory sits
                astride the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva. It was one of Europe's first
                joint ventures and now has 23 member states. Physicists and engineers at CERN use the world's
                largest
                and most complex scientific instruments to study the basic
                constituents of matter – fundamental particles. Subatomic particles are made to collide together at
                close to the speed
                of light. The process gives us clues about how the particles interact, and provides insights into
                the
                fundamental laws
                of nature.</p>

            <p>The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators
                boost
                beams of
                particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary
                targets. Detectors
                observe and record the results of these collisions <a href="https://home.cern/about">[7]</a>.</p>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>A particle accelerator is a machine that accelerates elementary particles, such as electrons or
                    protons, to very high
                    energies. On a basic level, particle accelerators produce beams of charged particles that can be
                    used for a variety of
                    research purposes. There are two basic types of particle accelerators: linear accelerators and
                    circular accelerators.
                    Linear accelerators propel particles along a linear, or straight, beam line. Circular
                    accelerators
                    propel particles
                    around a circular track. Linear accelerators are used for fixed-target experiments, whereas
                    circular
                    accelerators can be
                    used for both colliding beam and fixed target experiments <a

            <h3 class="mb-3">How do Accelerators Work?</h3>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>Particle accelerators use electric fields to speed up and increase the energy of a beam of
                    particles,
                    which are steered
                    and focused by magnetic fields. The particle source provides the particles, such as protons or
                    electrons, that are to be
                    accelerated. The beam of particles travels inside a vacuum in the metal beam pipe. The vacuum is
                    crucial to maintaining
                    an air and dust free environment for the beam of particles to travel unobstructed.
                    Electromagnets
                    steer and focus the
                    beam of particles while it travels through the vacuum tube.</p>

                <p>Electric fields spaced around the accelerator switch from positive to negative at a given
                    frequency,
                    creating radio
                    waves that accelerate particles in bunches. Particles can be directed at a fixed target, such as
                    a
                    thin piece of metal
                    foil, or two beams of particles can be collided. Particle detectors record and reveal the
                    particles
                    and radiation that
                    are produced by the collision between a beam of particles and the target <a

            <div id="LHC-msg">
                <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It
                    consists of a 27-kilometre ring
                    of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the
                    particles along the way.
                </p>

                <p>Inside the accelerator, two high-energy particle beams travel at close to the speed of light
                    before
                    they are made to
                    collide. The beams travel in opposite directions in separate beam pipes – two tubes kept at
                    ultrahigh vacuum. They are
                    guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field maintained by superconducting
                    electromagnets. The
                    electromagnets are built from coils of special electric cable that operates in a superconducting
                    state, efficiently
                    conducting electricity without resistance or loss of energy. This requires chilling the magnets
                    to
                    ‑271.3°C – a
                    temperature colder than outer space. For this reason, much of the accelerator is connected to a
                    distribution system of
                    liquid helium, which cools the magnets, as well as to other supply services.</p>

                <p>Thousands of magnets of different varieties and sizes are used to direct the beams around the
                    accelerator. These include
                    1232 dipole magnets 15 metres in length which bend the beams, and 392 quadrupole magnets, each
                    5–7
                    metres long, which
                    focus the beams. Just prior to collision, another type of magnet is used to "squeeze" the
                    particles
                    closer together to
                    increase the chances of collisions. The particles are so tiny that the task of making them
                    collide
                    is akin to firing two
                    needles 10 kilometres apart with such precision that they meet halfway. <a

                        Hadron Collider (LHC). It is designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at
                        extreme
                        energy densities, where a phase of matter
                        called quark-gluon plasma forms. </p>

                    <p>All ordinary matter in today’s universe is made up of atoms. Each atom contains a nucleus
                        composed of
                        protons and
                        neutrons (except hydrogen, which has no neutrons), surrounded by a cloud of electrons.
                        Protons
                        and
                        neutrons are in turn
                        made of quarks bound together by other particles called gluons. No quark has ever been
                        observed
                        in
                        isolation: the
                        quarks, as well as the gluons, seem to be bound permanently together and confined inside
                        composite
                        particles, such as
                        protons and neutrons. This is known as confinement.</p>

                    <p>Collisions in the LHC generate temperatures more than 100,000 times hotter than the centre of
                        the
                        Sun. For part of each
                        year the LHC provides collisions between lead ions, recreating in the laboratory conditions
                        similar
                        to those just after
                        the Big Bang. Under these extreme conditions, protons and neutrons "melt", freeing the
                        quarks
                        from
                        their bonds with the
                        gluons. This is quark-gluon plasma. The existence of such a phase and its properties are key
                        issues
                        in the theory of
                        quantum chromodynamics (QCD), for understanding the phenomenon of confinement, and for a
                        physics
                        problem called
                        chiral-symmetry restoration. The ALICE collaboration studies the quark-gluon plasma as it
                        expands
                        and cools, observing
                        how it progressively gives rise to the particles that constitute the matter of our universe
                        today.

                    <p>The ALICE collaboration uses the 10,000-tonne ALICE detector – 26 m long, 16 m high, and 16 m

                        to study

                    <p>The LHCb experiment is situated at one of the four points around CERN’s Large Hadron Collider
                        where
                        beams of protons
                        are
                        smashed together, producing an array of different particles.</p>
                    <p>The aim of the LHCb experiment is to record the decay of particles containing b and anti-b
                        quarks,
                        collectively known
                        as
                        ‘B mesons’. The experiment’s 4,500 tonne detector is specifically designed to filter out
                        these
                        particles and the
                        products of their decay.</p>

                    <p>Rather than flying out in all directions, B mesons formed by the colliding proton beams (and
                        the
                        particles they decay
                        into) stay close to the line of the beam pipe, and this is reflected in the design of the
                        detector.
                        Other LHC
                        experiments surround the entire collision point with layers of sub-detectors, like an onion,
                        but
                        the
                        LHCb detector
                        stretches for 20 metres along the beam pipe, with its sub-detectors stacked behind each
                        other
                        like
                        books on a shelf.
                    </p>

                    <p>Each one of LHCb’s sub-detectors specializes in measuring a different characteristic of the

                        produced by
                        colliding protons. Collectively, the detector’s components gather information about the

                        trajectory,

                    <p>The detector itself is a many-layered instrument designed to detect some of the tiniest yet

                        individually
                        identified
                        and measured. A huge magnet system bends the paths of the charged particles so that their
                        momenta
                        can be measured as

                    <p>The Compact Muon Solenoid (or CMS) detector sits at one of these four collision points of the
                        LHC. It
                        is a
                        general-purpose
                        detector; that is, it is designed to observe any new physics phenomena that the LHC might
                        reveal.
                    </p>

                    <p>CMS acts as a giant, high-speed camera, taking 3D “photographs” of particle collisions from
                        all
                        directions up to 40
                        million times each second. Although most of the particles produced in the collisions are
                        “unstable”,
                        they transform
                        rapidly into stable particles that can be detected by CMS. By identifying (nearly) all the
                        stable
                        particles produced
                        in
                        each collision, measuring their momenta and energies, and then piecing together the
                        information
                        of
                        all these
                        particles
                        like putting together the pieces of a puzzle, the detector can recreate an “image” of the
                        collision
                        for further
                        analysis.</p>

                    <p>The final particle that CMS observe directly is the muon. Muons belong to the same family of
                        particles as the
                        electron,
                        although they are around 200 times heavier. They are not stopped by the calorimeters, so
                        special
                        sub-detectors have
                        to
                        be built to detect them as they traverse CMS. These sub-detectors are interleaved with the
                        return
                        yoke of the
                        solenoid.
                        The large magnet of CMS also allows us to measure each muon’s momentum both inside the
                        superconducting coil (by the
                        tracking devices) and outside of it (by the muon chambers) <a
