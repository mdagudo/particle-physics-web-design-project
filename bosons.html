                <p>Bosons are the elementary subatomic particles that exert the fundamental forces. They are, in other
                    words, the carriers
                    of the four fundamental interactions: gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the
                    strong nuclear force.
                    They do not compose matter but they do allow the forces that govern the behavior of the Universe to
                    emerge from the
                    quantum world <a
                        href="https://enorcerna.com/wiki/science/the-6-types-of-bosons-and-their-characteristics/">[6]</a>.
                </p>

                <p>All bosons have either zero spin or an even integer spin. Unlike fermions, bosons do not comply with
                    the Pauli exclusion principle and they may occupy the exact same quantum state as other bosons, as
                    for example in the case of laser light which is formed of coherent, overlapping
                    photons. In fact, the more bosons there are in a state the more likely that another boson will join
                    that state (Bose
                    condensation).</p>

                <p>Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the
                    four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the Higgs boson, and the still-theoretical
                    graviton of quantum gravity; composite
                    particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and
                    one neutron, mass
                    number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and
                    phonons) <a href="https://www.clearias.com/fermions-and-bosons/">[4]</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="gauge">Gauge Bosons</h3>
            <img src="images/higgs_force_field_0_0.jpg" alt="" class="col-md-6 float-md-end my-md-3 ms-md-3 mx-auto d-block">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>These are responsible for the four forces. Within the Gauge Bosons group there are: photons, gluons,
                    Z bosons and W bosons.</p>

                <h4>Photons</h4>
                <p>Photons are a type of massless bosons with no electrical charge. We can also understand photons as
                    "the particles of light", so they
                    allow the existence of the wave spectrum where visible light, microwaves, infrared, gamma rays, and
                    ultraviolet are
                    found. , etc.</p>

                <p>The electromagnetic force, which is carried by these photons, is the elemental force of interaction
                    that occurs between
                    electrically charged particles positively or negatively. All electrically charged particles
                    experience this force, which is manifested by an attraction (if they are of different
                    charge) or a repulsion (if they are of the same charge) <a
                        href="https://enorcerna.com/wiki/science/the-6-types-of-bosons-and-their-characteristics/">[6]</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Gluons</h4>
                <p>Gluons are a type of boson without mass and without electrical charge, but with a color charge, so it
                    not only transmits a force, but also experiences it itself.</p>

                <p>Either way, the important thing is that gluons are responsible for the strong nuclear force. Gluons
                    are the carrier particles for the interaction that constitutes the "glue" of atoms. The strong
                    nuclear force
                    allows protons and neutrons to stick together (through the strongest interaction in the Universe),
                    thus maintaining the
                    integrity of the atomic nucleus.</p>

                <p>These gluonic particles transmit a force 100 times stronger than that transmitted by photons
                    (electromagnetic) and that
                    is of a shorter range, but enough to prevent the protons, which have a positive charge, repel each
                    other. Gluons ensure
                    that, despite electromagnetic repulsions, protons and neutrons remain attached to the nucleus of the
                    atom <a
                        href="https://enorcerna.com/wiki/science/the-6-types-of-bosons-and-their-characteristics/">[6]</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Z and W Bosons</h4>
                <p>Z bosons are a type of very massive bosons that, together with W, are responsible for mediating the
                    weak nuclear force. Unlike Ws, Z bosons are electrically neutral and somewhat more massive than
                    they. </p>

                <p>The Z and W bosons are the particles that make possible the existence of this force that allows
                    protons, neutrons and
                    electrons to disintegrate into other subatomic particles. </p>

                <p>We have positively charged (W +) and negatively charged (W-) bosons W. But, at the end of the day,
                    their role is the
                    same as that of the Z bosons, since they carry the same interaction <a

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>There's only one scalar boson with spin 0 discovered to date, the Higgs Boson. The discovery of the
                    Higgs boson in 2012 was so important because the detection of this boson particle was proof that
                    the Higgs field existed. </p>

                <p>That is, the important thing was not the particle itself (the boson), but to confirm the existence of
                    the associated
                    field. The Higgs field is a quantum field, a kind of cloth that permeates the entire Universe and
                    that it extends
                    throughout all space, giving rise to a medium that interacts with the fields of the rest of the
                    standard model
                    particles, providing them with mass.</p>

                <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson allowed us to understand the fundamental origin of mass. Mass, then,
                    is not an intrinsic property of matter. It is an extrinsic property that depends on the degree to
                    which a
                    particle is affected by the Higgs field. Those that have the most affinity for this field will be
                    the most massive (like
                    quarks); while those with the least affinity will be the least massive. If a photon has no mass, it
                    is because it does
                    not interact with this Higgs field <a
